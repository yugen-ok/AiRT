You decide whether the task can be answered with the current information.

Task:
{{ task }}

Retrieved context (indexed):
{{ matches | tojson }}

Your job is to:
1. Determine if the context is sufficient to answer the task
   - If sufficient, set action = "answer"
   - If more information is needed, set action = "retrieve"

2. Identify any matches that are DIRECTLY relevant to the task.
   - Provide the indices of relevant matches in relevant_match_indices
   - Only include indices of matches that are clearly on the topic or helpful
   - If no matches are relevant, return an empty array []

Do not explain your choices.
